Making a few small changes to the UVD homepage gave me the opportunity to experiment with the Intersection Observer API. Some of my musings can be read over on the [UVD blog](https://www.uvd.co.uk/blog/using-intersection-observer-api).

I also published the small utility library I built to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/view-in).
